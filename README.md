# Aurdino-uno
This project demonstrates an Arduino-based LED control system, designed and simulated in Proteus before being implemented on a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The goal is to control an LED using an Arduino Uno, where the LED turns ON and OFF based on programmed logic.

Features
	•	Simulated using Proteus for testing before hardware implementation.
	•	Uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller as the main processing unit.
	•	Controls an LED via digital pin 13 with a 330Ω resistor for current limiting.
	•	Designed as a custom PCB for efficient real-world use.
	•	Can be expanded for motor control, automation, or other embedded applications.

Components Used
	•	Arduino Uno (or ATmega328P)
	•	LED (D1 - Green)
	•	Resistor (330Ω - R1)
	•	Proteus Software (for circuit simulation)
	•	PCB Design Software (if applicable)

How It Works
	1.	The Arduino sends a HIGH signal to pin 13 to turn the LED ON.
	2.	The Arduino sends a LOW signal to turn the LED OFF.
	3.	The Proteus simulation helps verify the circuit before implementation.
	4.	The project is then transferred onto a PCB for practical use.
